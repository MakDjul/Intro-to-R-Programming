#The purpose of this assignment was to define assignment2 and myMean
#Originally, the myMean() did not output as desired. I was tasked with testing the function in order to find ways to fix it.

> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) }

#the object 'assignment' is not properly defined
> myMean()
Error in myMean() : object 'assignment' not found        

#renamed 'assignment' to 'assignment2'
> myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/length(someData)) }    

#the function requires the argument to be 'assignment 2'
> myMean()
Error in myMean() : argument "assignment2" is missing, with no default   

#replaced 'assignment2' with 'x' as argument for increase ease of calling the function
> myMean <- function(x) { return(sum(assignment2)/length(someData)) }       

#the object 'someData' was not defined
> myMean()
Error in myMean() : object 'someData' not found         

#defined someData as the length of 'assignment2'
> someData <- c(1:12)      

#success!!
> myMean()
