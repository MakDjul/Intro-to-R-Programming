#This module was focused on matrices and functions associated with calculating determinants and inverse matrices.

#Create the matrices
> A <- matrix(1:100, nrow=10) 
> B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)

#Matrix A Functions - solving for determinants and inverse matrix
> detA <- det(A)   #Solve for derminant of A
> deta
[1] 0    #The determinant of A is 0
> invA <- solve(A)   #Solve for inverse of A
Error in solve.default(A) : 
  Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[6,6] = 0
#When solving for the inverse of A, there is an error output. This happens because the determinant of A is O.

#Matrix B Functions - solving for determinants and inverse matrix
> detB <- det(B)   #Solve for determinant of B
Error in determinant.matrix(x, logarithm = TRUE, ...) : 
  'x' must be a square matrix
#When solving for the determinant of B, there is an error output. This happens because B is not a square matrix.
> invB <- solve(B)
Error in solve.default(B) : 'a' (10 x 100) must be square
#When solving for the inverse of B, there is an error output. This happens because, like with the determinant function, B must be a square matrix.
