#Define the two matrices of interest: A & B
A <- matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol=2)
B <- matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol=2)

#Define object as the addition of A & B
C <- A + B

#Define object as the subtraction of B from A
D <- A - B

#Create diagonal (4 by 4 matrix)  with 4, 1, 2, and 3 
E <- diag(c(4,1,2,3))

##The following matrix was presented and we needed to recreate it
#Create a diagonal of 3s in a 5 by 5 matrix
G <- diag(3, nrow=5)
#In the first row and columns 2 to 5, assign 1 to those elements
G[1, 2:5] <- 1
#In rows 2 to 5 of the first column, assign 2 to those elements
G[2:5, 1] <- 2

#Assignment Complete!
