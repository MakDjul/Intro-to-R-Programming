#This assignment is focused on Visualization in R
#The three types of visualization include: basic, lattice and ggplot

#Access file of interest; downloaded from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html
#Item type of the downloaded data is 'remission' and the title is 'Cancer Remission and Cell Activity'
> mydata <- read.table("/Users/Mak_Djulbegovic/Desktop/remission.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#Generate graph with basic 'plot()' function
> plot(mydata)
> plot(mydata, main="Various graphs generated by plot function")

#Generate graph with lattice package
> install.packages("lattice")
> library(lattice)
> plot <- xyplot(X~LI, data=mydata, pch=".", main="X vs LI plot")
> print(plot)

#Generate graph with ggplot
> library(ggplot2)
> newplot <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x=X, y=LI))
> newplot + geom_line(linetype=6)
