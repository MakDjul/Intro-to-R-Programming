Description: The data set contains eight ALDH2 markers for Japanese alcohlic patients and controls.
    The package will analyze the two varients for the eight marker loci of interest. The aim is to 
    uncover the function of these alleles as a predictor for Alcoholism. Data visualization tools
    will be used to aid in assessment of possible associations between the gene varients and alcoholism.
    Graphing the data allow for clear presentation, allowing for reliable conclusions to be made regarding 
    the associations between ALDH2 markers and alcholism in Japanese patients.
